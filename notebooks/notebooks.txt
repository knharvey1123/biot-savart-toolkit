Four notebooks:
- discretized_shapes includes discretization for a ring, a Kelvin ring, a perturbed ring, and a Hasimoto soliton
- kb_curvature includes curvature evolutions for the four discretized shapes using the Local Induction Approximation to induce binormal movement
- kb_flow simulates binormal flow for the ring, the Kelvin ring, and the Hasimoto soliton using Euler method
- kb_flow_rk4 simulates binormal flow for the ring, the Kelvin ring, and the Hasimoto soliton using RK4method
