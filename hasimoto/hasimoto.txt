Hasimoto soliton evolution
This folder includes code and results specific for the Hasimoto soliton, provides an in-depth look 
at the progression of simulating binormal flow starting with the Local Induction Approximation to the 
Generalized Local Induction Equation to the binormal component of Biot-Savat Integral

binormal_hs.py
    - The simplest form of the self-induced binormal flow
    - gamma_t = kB (known commonly as the Local Induction Approximation)
    - Takes a hasimoto soliton and evolves it through time using the above formula
        - k and B calculated using the Frenet-Serret frame
        - Hasimoto soliton draws parametrization from Hasimoto 1972 paper

partial_binormal_hs.py
    - Slightly more complex self-induced binormal flow
    - Introduces another term in a Taylor Approximation
    - gamma_t = k(1 + epsilon*k^2)B 

partial_BSI_hs.py
    - BSI-induced binormal flow
    - Uses equation from Strong 2018
        - last term of the derived BSI equation
    - BSI equation housed in BSI_integral.py
    - Uses arcspline interpolation to pull parameters at each material point

BSI_integral.py
    - integral from Strong 2018 used in BSI-induced binormal flow
    - int(L1, L2) {(cos(x) - 1) dx / (c1 + c2 * np.cos(x))**1.5}
      c1 = epsilon**2 - 2 * epsilon * cos(phi) + 2
      c2 = 2 * epsilon * cos(phi) - 2

arcspline_interpolator.py
    - helper function used to pull parameters at each material point
    - returns radius, L1, L2
